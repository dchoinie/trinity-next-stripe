                            Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church has been proclaming the Gospel of the death and resurrection of Jesus to the people of Waterville and the surrounding communities since 1909. We are an imperfect group of sinners gathered around our shared confession of Jesus and His Gospel.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            We are formed and shaped by the Holy Scriptures. And we worship according to the historic liturgy of the Church. With the help of God, we intend to bear faithful witness to Jesus, to show His mercy to all, and to live our life together in His Church until He comes again in glory on the Last Day.
